Hi! I am an [Instructor](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sai-zhang) in the [Department of Genetics](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html) at [Stanford University School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/). I received postdoctoral training in Dr. [Michael Snyder](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html)'s group at Stanford Genetics. Prior to that, I got a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Dr. [Jianyang Zeng](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zengjy/).

Our research lies at the interface of machine learning, genomics, and precision medicine. Our long-term goal is to build machine learning systems to assist scientific discovery, clinical decision making, and personal health management. Our current research is focused on deciphering the genomic basis of human complex diseases. To this end, we develop
