I got involved in research during my sophomore year of undergraduate. I loved the research process and from then on, I kept getting involved in multiple research opportunities in Alaska and Illinois. After getting my baccalaureate, I did a postbaccalaureate program at the University of Illinois Chicago before coming to Stanford for my Ph.D.
