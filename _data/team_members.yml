  education1: Bio&#58; I am a genetics PhD student interested in leveraging human genetic variation and integrative multi-omic analyses to prevent, monitor, diagnose, and/or treat disease in a personalized manner. I am especially interested in predicting personal disease-risk profiles and building models for solving undiagnosed or rare disease cases. I was born and raised in northern Virginia and did my undergrad at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. At UVA, I majored in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have experience studying rare diseases (Mastocytosis, Hypereosinophilia, Pseudohypoparathyroidism), epigenetics of liver metabolism, and the genetics/molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease in Lupus patients.
